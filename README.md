# Research and Reflection Journal

## Week 8
### Reading the Research & Reflection Assignment Description

**Date Completed:** 29 Feb 2024

I dived into the Research & Reflection assignment on Brightspace and worked on this crucial step, creating a repository for the assignment, and creating a readme file where the journal entries will be entered.

**Reflection:** Helped my approach to nail each activity thoughtfully. It's all about keeping my journal tidy, packed with info, reflective, and totally complete.

### Researching a New Programming Language: Haskell

**Date Completed:** 26 Feb 2024

### Research Findings:

- **Purpose of Haskell:** Haskell is the go-to for academic research and crafting complex apps where trust is key, like in the money and aerospace worlds.
- **Users of Haskell:** Mostly eggheads and pros in industries craving sturdy software solutions.
- **Useful Resources:**
    - [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) – A fab, newbie-friendly guide. (Read it online for free)
    - [Haskell.org](https://www.haskell.org/) – The official Haskell hotspot.

**Reflection:** Learned a lot about Haskell programming language and I’m completely new to this language, I’m not even sure if I heard of this language before considering the fact that I learned quite a lot of programming languages during my time at university. Got to know that Haskell has rock-solid software efficiency and prowess.

### Writing a User Story for a Messaging App

**Date Completed:** 26 Feb 2024

- **General User Story:** "As a user, I want to send a message to chat with my peeps."
- **Specific User Stories:**
    - "As a user, I can pull up a contact list to pick someone for messaging."
    - "As a user, I can add new buddies to grow my chat circle."

**Acceptance Criteria for 'Add new contact':**

- There's a snazzy 'Add new contact' button.
- Contacts show up clear as day.
- A handy tool helps scroll through long lists of contacts.

**Reflection:** Even though I have previously practiced crafting user stories in a couple of other DGL classes, crafting these user stories helped me to polish my skill once again.

### Choosing a Language for Community Code: Kotlin

**Date Completed:** 26 Feb 2024

- **Chosen Language:** JavaScript
- **Experience Level:** 1 Semester in DGL, also worked on a practical node.js project for university capstone in 2021.
- **Reason for Choice:** Keen to get better at JavaScript.

**Reflection:** Opting for JavaScript since I will have to use it for both Mobile as well as Web apps throughout my career.

### Exploring GitHub for Community Code Project

**Date Completed:** 29 Feb 2024

I zipped through GitHub's Explore area, marking favorites on topics and repos linked to JavaScript especially node.js framework, eyeing up communities and projects to jump into.

**Reflection:** This GitHub safari boosted my know-how of the open-source scene, showing off the perks of joining forces with the community for shared learning and building cool stuff.

## Reflection on Week 8

A lot of new and fun activities, from getting the gist of Haskell’s role in the tech world to hands-on action in user story writing and picking a language for the Community Code gig. The GitHub journey really hit home on the community's big deal in software making, laying the groundwork for more awesome learn-and-build adventures in this course.
