### Writing a User Story for a Messaging App

This exercise was done in a group with my group consisting of Lara and Nazrin. However, since I didn't save our group work anywhere, I'm creating another one as an example. This will also help be another little practice session for me in building user stories.

**Date Completed:** 26 Feb 2024

- **General User Story:** "As a user, I want to send a message to chat with my peeps."
- **Specific User Stories:**
    - "As a user, I can pull up a contact list to pick someone for messaging."
    - "As a user, I can add new buddies to grow my chat circle."

**Acceptance Criteria for 'Add new contact':**

- There's a snazzy 'Add new contact' button.
- Contacts show up clear as day.
- A handy tool helps scroll through long lists of contacts.

**Reflection:** Even though I have previously practiced crafting user stories in a couple of other DGL classes, crafting these user stories helped me to polish my skill once again.

### Reading "How to Contribute to Open Source"

**Date Completed:** 08 Mar 2028

This guide was a treasure trove, laying out the A to Z of chipping in to open source, from the big picture to picking the right projects.

**Reflection:** The guide broadened my view on open-source gigs, showing it’s not just about coding but also helping with docs, design, and community vibes. However, I noticed a lot of tasks were pretty old, especially when it comes to frameworks, there has been significant updates and were not throwing errors, but I figured a secret tip to search for issues on GitHub ( label:"good first issue" language:JavaScript ). This helped me a lot to find plenty of new issues where I have the opportunity to contribute before anyone else.

### Summary of Open Source Contributions:

1. **Understanding Contribution:** It's more than code; it's about docs, community, and support too.
2. **Finding a Project:** Tools like GitHub Explore and Open Source Friday are my maps to projects that match my interests and skills.

### Finding Potential Projects to Contribute To

**Date Completed:** 08 Mar 2028

I ventured into Good First Issue, Up for Grabs, and CodeTriage, eyeing Kotlin projects because mobile development is my jam.

### Projects Explored:

1. **Project A:** https://github.com/react-toolbox/react-toolbox/issues/1774 - Grabbed my attention since it was an easy fix, however this was already fixed and merged. But the interesting part was the fix for the issue wasn’t an ideal solution.
2. **Project B:** https://github.com/yelynn1/tictactoe/issues/132 - Loved its community vibe and solid guides, however even this was solved. What I noticed in both these issues that annoyed me was that, the contributor’s didn’t bother to comment on the issue, so when I initially saw the issue I thought it wasn’t touched by anyone yet.

**Reflection:** This hunt showed the rich variety of open-source projects, all needing different kinds of help, from coding to docs and leading the charge.

Back to GitHub, I zeroed in on issues marked "good first issue" or "help wanted" in the projects I liked.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Issue A:** https://github.com/prateekkalra/guess-game/issues/8 - This seemed pretty interesting and easy to solve
2. **Issue B:** https://github.com/prateekkalra/guess-game/issues/62 - This felt way too easy

**Reflection:** This step hammered home that open-source help comes in many flavors, and every little bit adds up to big wins for the project.
