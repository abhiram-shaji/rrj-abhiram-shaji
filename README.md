# Research and Reflection Journal

## Week 8
### Reading the Research & Reflection Assignment Description

**Date Completed:** 29 Feb 2024

I dived into the Research & Reflection assignment on Brightspace and worked on this crucial step, creating a repository for the assignment, and creating a readme file where the journal entries will be entered.

**Reflection:** Helped my approach to nail each activity thoughtfully. It's all about keeping my journal tidy, packed with info, reflective, and totally complete.

### Researching a New Programming Language: Haskell

**Date Completed:** 26 Feb 2024

### Research Findings:

- **Purpose of Haskell:** According to the book "Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming" by Simon Thompson, Haskell is primarily used in academic research and for developing complex applications where trust is essential, such as in the financial and aerospace sectors.
- **Users of Haskell:** As noted on the Haskell.org website, Haskell is predominantly utilized by academics and professionals in industries that require robust software solutions.
- **Useful Resources:**
    - [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) – A fab, newbie-friendly guide. (Read it online for free)
    - [Haskell.org](https://www.haskell.org/) – The official Haskell hotspot.

**Reflection:** Learned a lot about Haskell programming language and I’m completely new to this language, I’m not even sure if I heard of this language before considering the fact that I learned quite a lot of programming languages during my time at university. Got to know that Haskell has rock-solid software efficiency and prowess.

### Writing a User Story for a Messaging App

This exercise was done in a group with my group consisting of Lara and Nazrin. However, since I didn't save our group work anywhere, I'm creating another one as an example. This will also help be another little practice session for me in building user stories.

**Date Completed:** 26 Feb 2024

Creating user stories is a fundamental aspect of Agile software development, aimed at capturing product features from the end user's perspective. According to Mike Cohn in his book "User Stories Applied," user stories help teams focus on delivering value to the customer by describing how a software feature will be used in simple and concise terms. They typically follow a simple template: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]." This approach not only facilitates clear communication but also aids in prioritizing development tasks based on user needs.

- **General User Story:** "As a user, I want to send a message to chat with my peeps."
- **Specific User Stories:**
    - "As a user, I can pull up a contact list to pick someone for messaging."
    - "As a user, I can add new buddies to grow my chat circle."

**Acceptance Criteria for 'Add new contact':**

- There's a snazzy 'Add new contact' button.
- Contacts show up clear as day.
- A handy tool helps scroll through long lists of contacts.

**Reflection:** Even though I have previously practiced crafting user stories in a couple of other DGL classes, crafting these user stories helped me to polish my skill once again.

### Choosing a Language for Community Code: Kotlin

**Date Completed:** 26 Feb 2024

![Slack message](image.png)

- **Chosen Language:** JavaScript
- **Experience Level:** 1 Semester in DGL, also worked on a practical node.js project for university capstone in 2021.
- **Reason for Choice:** Keen to get better at JavaScript.

**Reflection:** Opting for JavaScript since I will have to use it for both Mobile as well as Web apps throughout my career.

### Exploring GitHub for Community Code Project

**Date Completed:** 29 Feb 2024

I zipped through GitHub's Explore area, marking favorites on topics and repos linked to JavaScript, especially the node.js framework, eyeing up communities and projects to jump into. I found an interesting JavaScript issue that seems perfect for me to try out to resolve; it seems to be an error in a tic-tac-toe game where if the user wins and redoes the previous move and wins again, every time the user wins, the sound button that pops up after victory just duplicates on every attempt.

## Week 9
### Weekly Content on Design Patterns

**Date Attended: 04 Mar 2024**

Learned design patterns are like secret recipes for coding troubles, giving us smart ways to tackle common problems. They make our code neat and easy for other coders to get.

**Reflection:** Design patterns really click with me, seem pretty much of a lifesaver! It show the power of organized problem-solving in coding, turning abstract ideas into real solutions for tricky tasks.

---

### Reading the Community Code Assignment

**Date Completed:** 08 Mar 2028

I checked out the Community Code gig on Brightspace, learning all about the perks of diving into open source and what's expected from our contributions. Also, I took a brief glance at the community code project requirements and noted the important aspects according to the rubrics:

**Contributions:** These should match what the community wants. For example, if the community values innovation, the contributions should be innovative.

**Contributions:** These need to be valuable and fit well with community goals, like contributing useful code in a coding community.

**Documentation:** This needs to be very clear and detailed, showing a deep understanding of the topic, like a well-explained guide on how to use software. Also, the importance of including CONTRIBUTING.md and README.md files is emphasized.

**Code:** The code should not only meet but often exceed the community's standards, and be organized, like writing cleaner and more efficient code.

**User Support:** Support should meet or exceed what the community expects and help both new and current users significantly, like offering helpful and clear answers to users' problems.

**Commits:** These should be made regularly, make sense, and each change should be well explained, like consistently providing clear updates in a project's log.



**Reflection:** This task gave me the idea of boosting my own skills and helping the whole code-loving community.

### Research and Reflection Journal Rubrics

Similar to the Community Code Rubrics, for Research and Reflection Journal I noted the following important rubrics:

- Journal entries should be clear and thoroughly written.
- Entries should reflect deep and meaningful learnings, encouraging further thought.
- Bibliography needs to be well formatted and of high-quality, also should follow citation rules.
- The journal's structure should enhance its reflective content.
- Facts needs to be well-supported with relevant evidence.
- In-text citations should be accurately used.
- GitHub repo should be properly named and created in the course organization by Week 9.

**Reflection:** This task gave me an idea of what is expected of me in terms of organizing documenting the Journal.

### Reading "How to Contribute to Open Source"

**Date Completed:** 08 Mar 2028

This guide was a treasure trove, laying out the A to Z of chipping in to open source, from the big picture to picking the right projects.

**Reflection:** The guide broadened my view on open-source gigs, showing it’s not just about coding but also helping with docs, design, and community vibes. However, I noticed a lot of tasks were pretty old, especially when it comes to frameworks, there has been significant updates and were not throwing errors, but I figured a secret tip to search for issues on GitHub ( label:"good first issue" language:JavaScript ). This helped me a lot to find plenty of new issues where I have the opportunity to contribute before anyone else.

### Summary of Open Source Contributions:

1. **Understanding Contribution:** It's more than code; it's about docs, community, and support too.
2. **Finding a Project:** Tools like GitHub Explore and Open Source Friday are my maps to projects that match my interests and skills.

---

### Finding Potential Projects to Contribute To

**Date Completed:** 08 Mar 2028

I ventured into Good First Issue, Up for Grabs, and CodeTriage, eyeing Kotlin projects because mobile development is my jam.

### Projects Explored:

1. **Project A:** https://github.com/react-toolbox/react-toolbox/issues/1774 - Grabbed my attention since it was an easy fix, however this was already fixed and merged. But the interesting part was the fix for the issue wasn’t an ideal solution.
2. **Project B:** https://github.com/yelynn1/tictactoe/issues/132 - This is the same issue I took a glance during the previous week. Loved its community vibe and solid guides, however even this was solved. What I noticed in both these issues that annoyed me was that, the contributor’s didn’t bother to comment on the issue, so when I initially saw the issue I thought it wasn’t touched by anyone yet.

**Reflection:** This hunt showed the rich variety of open-source projects, all needing different kinds of help, from coding to docs and leading the charge.

---

### Exploring Community Connections

**Date Completed:** 08 Mar 2028

Went on searching for ideal communities that are suitable for me which is neither too complicated coding nor just beginner projects.

**Summary of Discoveries:**

- Found buzzing communities ready to support, teach, and collaborate.
- Realized how these groups are the heartbeat of project growth and contributor learning.

**Reflection:** Peeking into these communities unveiled their crucial role in keeping open-source projects alive and kicking, paving paths for meaningful contributions.

---

### Identifying Issues to Support

**Date Completed:** 08 Mar 2028

Back to identifying issues, I finalized on the issue I will be contributing and it's gonna be the tic-tac-toe game that I explored during week 8.

### Issue Finalized:

**Issue : Sound Button Duplication #132** https://github.com/yelynn1/tictactoe/issues/132 - This seemed pretty interesting and the logic seem pretty easy to understand. the best part is that, there hasn't been a solution that has been merged yet.

**Plan to Tackle the issue** 

For starters I made a fork to the project and made a new branch named "fix-sound-button-duplication".

My planned solution involves, modifying the checkWinner function to check if the sound button already exists before creating a new one. This prevents the duplication of the sound button.

![tic-tact-toe fork](image-2.png)

**Reflection:** This step hammered home that open-source help comes in many flavors, and every little bit adds up to big wins for the project.

---

### Week 11 Reflections

Tackling stuff with both the external community and the pattern-library project this week was a brain feast! Got my hands dirty with OOP insights, open-source giving, and team coding shenanigans.

**Reflection:** Getting the hang of Kotlin’s flex in both OOP and functional styles has widened my view on its toolkit, boosting my coding finesse across different project landscapes. Also I’m considering switching my language for community code project from JavaScript to Kotlin since nobody seem to be implementing Kotlin and I already have a hot understanding of the language since I worked on some intermediate projects last semester using Ktor framework. Also for the external community project, I’m eyeballing towards a community that uses both Python (for DB and app) and JavaScript (for front end manipulation), due to which I will use both programming language as a part of it.
